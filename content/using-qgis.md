# Using QGIS for Mapping and Spatial Analysis
**Learning Objective 3: Know when to use a reference map vs. a thematic map.**


GIS is used for making maps and spatial analysis. Spatial analysis involves using tools within the QGIS interface to answer spatial questions: 

>  **Spatial analysis** is the process of manipulating spatial information to extract new information and meaning from the original data. Usually spatial analysis is carried out with a Geographic Information System (GIS). A GIS usually provides spatial analysis tools for calculating feature statistics and carrying out geoprocessing activities as data interpolation. -- [QGIS](https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/spatial_analysis_interpolation.html#:~:text=Overview,Geographic%20Information%20System%20(GIS).)

The Research Commons facilitates workshops on mapmaking with QGIS, where the result is a static map of some kind, as well as workshops that focus on the tools & workflows involved in answering spatial questions. 

The following pages outline the two main kinds of maps: **reference maps** and **thematic maps**. Reference maps are descriptive, showing the lay of the land as it were, whereas thematic maps render the results of spatial analysis. Making reference maps is quite straightforward. Making thematic maps, on the other hand, involves manipulating your data in some way using tools inside a GIS.
